# Assignment 9
I trained an image generation model in Runway based on a dataset of floral [botanical drawings from the Biodiversity Heritage Library.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary)

I pulled 596 images from multiple albums, deleting photos such as drawings of the artists or full scenery, then put them in the image generation training part of Runway with the "illustration" setting selected. The images the model started out with to train were actually similar given they were illustrations of birds.

The model trained for 1936 steps before I ran out of Runway credits, which is also why I was unable to host the model for the Glitch interface. I would have wanted to have a page that generated a new random botanical drawing on refresh.
