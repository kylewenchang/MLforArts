# Long Short Term Story

For my project, I want to make a bot that types a story one word at a time, trading off "turns" with the user.

## Abstract
Using text generation with CharRNN, I want to make a game that lets the user play one word story with a machine learning model. The model would be trained on a variety of classic/children's stories, and generate text based on user input of a word. Because the text is generated on memory from only previously generated text, I hope that the base stories that I'm training on shouldn't have too strong of an influence, and just give the algorithm a vocabulary to work with and information about writing style/different patterns.

The interface would either be a chatbot style thing where the user types a word in a text bot and "sends" it to the story block of text, or just a continuous block of text that the user types in before the computer takes over and types a word when the user hits space. The computer would generate one character at a time until it generates a space; I also think this would be cool in terms of interface because it would be giving the bot a "typing" effect. It would be cool to add buttons to share the story (downloading, copying to clipboard, etc). It would either take place in a web interface or a p5 sketch.

With machine learning models, it's input to output, but I think by making the "output" a larger story, it allows the user to continously add input and influence future text generation.

## Inspiration
I like playing one word story.

However, sometimes it's hard to keep it going or introduce real action/story without a driving force behind it. It can be really fun when playing in a group where some people can carry things forward, but I'm not one of those people. (Machine learning is one of those people!)

I also think that text generation is facinating. I think about the saying about if monkeys could type; computers can sometimes be smarter than monkeys. We learn to tell based on stories we've heard the past, by picking up on patterns in them, and the fact that machine learning algorithms can do this in form is compelling to me.

## Audience
This project is for myself, people who want to play one word story as a game, a creative exercise, or just people who are curious about what their writing and a machin learning algorithm can form.
