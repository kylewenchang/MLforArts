For assignment 4, I decided to improve upon the in-class HandPose example by making it plot all of the points on the hand. I was able to do this without having to address individual point using loops, but this was actually a lot more difficult than I expected because I never found a way to access the subarrays in the array that HandPose outputs by index (for example, having to use ```handPoints[0][0].annotations.thumb[j][0];``` rather than something like ```handPoints[0][0][0][0][j][0];```, which would have allowed me to access the coordinated of all the points with a loop rather than having to address each section individually.)
